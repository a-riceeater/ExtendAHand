# ExtendAHand

A hackathon project for DynoHacks/ACE Coding (2023)

## Inspiration

As the theme is "social-good", I felt it was a good idea to create a web app for users so that they could get help on problems they need solving.

## What it does

Users may ask people for help when they need on various topics, like coding, cooking, etc. The user may join that group at any time to ask questions for those groups.

## How we built it

ExtendAHand is built on the [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com) framework, and used [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) for data storage.

All user data is encrypted on the server side, and authentication tokens are used to track user logins.

## Challenges we ran into

Some challenges were figuring out ways to store the post/comment data, etc.

Another problem was that I didn't have much time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I was able to do it all in around 4-6 hours total.

## What we learned

I learned new ways of storing stuff with SQL (using arrays in a value).

I also used more dynamic pages instead of static pages.

## What's next for ExtendAHand

I will probably add more features, fix bugs, and polish it.
