# ExtendAHand

A hackathon project for DynoHacks/ACE Coding (2023)

## Inspiration

As the theme is "social-good", I felt it was a good idea to create a web app for users so that they could get help on problems they need solving.

## What it does

Users may ask people for help when they need on various topics, like coding, cooking, etc.

## How we built it

ExtendAHand is built on the [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com) framework, and used [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) for data storage.

All user data is encrypted on the server side, and authentication tokens are used to track user logins.
